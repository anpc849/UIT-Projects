This repository contains the source code for DS104. You can use the following instructions to clone the repository and get started with the code.

## Contents
* `clickstream_assessments`: contains the code associated with the paper: [Process-BERT: A Framework for Representation Learning on Educational Process Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13607). I have fine-tuned several model architectures within this folder.
* `kafka`: contains code for simulating the click-stream data.
* `streamlit`: contains the code for running the demo app.
